Loops- a statement (repeats a block of code multiple code
used for repetative code

4 different types of loops
1) while loop
	int time=10;
	if(time<12) {
	system.out.println("good morning");
	}
WHILE LOOP EXAMPLE INSTEAD OF USING IF
	while (time<12) {
	system.out.println("good morning");
	}

	while loop syntax
	
	while(boolean condition) {
		code to be repeated;
	}
	

DO WHILE LOOP

do while loop syntax

do {
	code to be repeated
} while(boolean condition);


while vs. do while ---> both loops executed while condition is true

while loop first CHECKS condition-->if true --> executes code

do while first EXECUTES code-->then checks condition


FOR LOOP

for loop syntax

for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
	code to be repeated;
}


//Say Hello 5 times

for (int i=1; 1<=5 ; i++) {

	System.out.println("Hello");
}


WHEN TO USE EACH LOOP:

1) when we know how many times to repeat a block of code--> USE FOR LOOP

2) when we do not know if advance how many time to repeat block of code ---> USE WHILE OR DO WHILE
