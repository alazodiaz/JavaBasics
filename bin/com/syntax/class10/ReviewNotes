Java Class 10 Recap of Class 9

array-is a collection//a container object that stores and hold multiple values of the same type
Why do we need it?
	-when getting large data types it it easier to store large amount of data coming from different sources.
	-saves time, easier to store when working with a lot of data
How do we create an array and use an array?
	-Use a square bracket [], and variable name that we want to give, create an array of integers specifying the size (number of values) 
		also known as elements elements.
	-Arrays are fixed in size; meaning during the runtime are static container it cannot grow or shrink 
	-Array is called a data structure, values are stored and acressed and procced, works based on indexes
	-Access elements using indexes
	
	EXAMPLE)
	int [] nums=new int[4]; 
	

	nums[0]=10;
	
	System.out.println(nums[1]); //0 
	//if we don't put a specific value data types will default into 
	System.out.println(nums[4]); //RE: ArrayIndexOutOFBoundException:4// bc we only have 4 spaces
	
How to find out the size of the array?
	nums.length --> tells how many elements (numeric value)
	
	//how to get all elements from an array?
		-use FOR Loop bc we know that there will be a fixed number.
	
	for(int i=0; i<nums.length; i++) {
		System.out.println(nums[i]);
	}
	
	-------------------------------------------
	Enhanced For Loop// Advanced for Loop
	-faster
	-works ONLY when we work with array or collection
	-loops only one way/direction
	
	EXAMPLE:
		nums[0]=10;
		nums[1]=100;
		
		Start with for(), then specify which array/ collection we're working with goes on right side of : on the left side what will be each element.
		Then print out num
		
		for(int num:nums){
		System.out.println(num;
		}
