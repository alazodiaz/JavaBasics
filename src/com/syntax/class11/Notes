What is an object?
	everything around us is an object. For example, keyboard, mouse, glass, etc.
	objects can be defined based on how they look and how they behave. Objects in computer programming are also very similar.
	They have state (which helps us define that object looks like) and behaviors (what that object does)


Object Oriented Programming:
	is just a way of writing programs (easier )
	
	Why we should learn OOP?
		1) it will simplify the development of large programs.
		2) It will help us maintain and modify the existing code
		3) It helps us write more secure code
		4) it helps us avoid duplicate code.
