		 * What is type casting?
		 * type casting is converting one data type to another data type
		 * Why should I learn type casting?
		 * 	-So that we can use the code that is written by someone else to make our life easier
		 * 	or when we will be working in teams we will be able to merge the code
		 * What is the syntax for type casting?
		 * 	-When we are converting something smaller to larger we don't need to do anything 
		 * -it happens automatically, we just assign the variable 
		 * EXAMPLE:
		 * 
		 * int box=1234
		 * 
		 * long box2=box; // this is how it works and it is called implicit or widening automatic
		 * 
		 * however when we convert a larger data type to a smaller data type 
		 * then we this is how we do it:
		 * 
		 * Example:
		 * 
		 * long box1245454
		 * 
		 * int box2=(int) box; // Called Narrowing or Explicit or manual conversion
